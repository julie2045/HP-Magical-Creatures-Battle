}

//improvements:
//make use of the environments and change damage of creature depending on which environment they are in or have environment damage creature 
//have if and else for when user input numbers because if they do not put certain numbers, then it wil cause an erorr. 
//slow down the text when it loads so users can read it better 
//shorten the startGame function so that it is easier to read 

//future plans:
//make buttons instead of having the users input the numbers of the corresponding creature or environment
//learn how to make simple graphics to use for game
